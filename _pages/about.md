I'm a Research Assistant at the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Before that, I received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Sheffield, U.K., in 2022, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Manchester, U.K., in 2023, respectively. My research interests lie in medical image segmentation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT).

## Research Experience

Currently, I work as a research assistant at The Internet and Mobile Computing Laboratory (IMCL), directed by [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Web Intelligence Group, University College London (UCL), under the supervision of [Prof. Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/).
